          <h1>Jack and Allison</h1>
          <div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>
            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>For two people who have spent the last decade coding, it’s funny to think that their first encounter was in a chemistry class. During the spring semester of 2008 at Carnegie Mellon University, Jack would slog to “Intro to Modern Chemistry” every week and wander to the back of the room. In between the boring lectures he noticed a pretty girl sitting a few rows in front of him carrying a Phantom of the Opera bag.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Several months later, fortune would bring them together when Allison joined the board of Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC), a Chinese cultural club. It was the first meeting of the year and Allison was running late. She quietly snuck into the meeting room and found only one seat open. As usual, nobody seemed to want to sit next to Jack. Allison, being a new member, was none the wiser.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>
            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>From here the two talked for the first time. The terribly interesting topic: How to hand your resume to recruiters at a job fair. After a series of ARCC dumpling nights and chance encounters in the computer lab, a very peculiar thing happened. The pair was chatting on AOL Instant Messenger when Jack asked Allison if she had eaten dinner yet. She replied with a confused “No” and hasty plans were made.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>It was Lulu’s Noodles that would play host to the future couple’s first date. While the food was less than spectacular, Allison ended the meal with a fortune cookie that would change her life forever: Accept the next proposition you hear. With the blessing of the fortune cookie gods and a nervous smile, Jack made a proposition and Allison accepted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>
            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>For the following two years, the couple enjoyed their time together bouncing amongst classes, ARCC events, and company info sessions with free pizza. Along the way, Jack decided to run the yearly ARCC cultural show with Allison as his secretary. Everything was going perfectly until the 2010 graduation came along and forced Jack to get a job in California. In the meantime, Allison still had her senior year to finish in Pittsburgh.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Thus began a one year stretch where Allison and Jack would talk on the phone a lot and tell each other what they had for lunch. Allison decided she would also try her hand at running the ARCC cultural show and Jack had a surprise for her at the end. Although 2,500 miles separated them, their love remained true.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='image_cell'>

            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Luckily, all the tech companies in the world are in the San Francisco Bay Area and no interview questions could keep such a powerful love apart. Allison found a job in 2011 and the couple was finally united under one roof. It was then when they decided to invite two tiny balls of fur into their lives.</p>

            <div class='text'>
              <p>Dragon is the spoiled baby of the family. As a kitten she was an adorable and loving companion and as she grew, she produced a never ending gallery of cute cat pictures. Jokulhaups was a tiny, destructive force that never seemed short of energy. As he grew, both in age and in size, he settled into a grumpy old man who opens doors and sulks under tables.</p>

            <div class='text'>
              <p>The family of four enjoyed their daily lives until Jack got bored at work. In 2012, he moved to a mobile game company called Storm8. He was enjoying himself so much that seven months and one referral bonus later, Allison also joined Storm8. Together, they work late into the night shipping games and having a blast doing it.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Everything was going fine and dandy until an innocuous Tuesday night in 2013 when Allison attended a piano concert in San Francisco. Little did she know that the true show was waiting for her at home. As she walked through her apartment door she was greeted by a ravishing young lad with a bouquet of flowers. He slowly escorted her to a piano to play and sing a touching love song he wrote. As the melody subsided (with only one or two mistakes), he took to his knee and said a bunch of stuff. tldr Allison said yes.</p>

              <p>In 2009, Piggy was one of the most famous and sought-after piggy models in the business. He was constantly seen on the cover of Piggy Weekly and Piggy Insider. Piggypolitan listed him as one of the top 10 best-looking male piggies of all time. Life moved fast and Piggy found himself never having time to truly enjoy himself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='text'>
              <p>Emo Piggy was a quiet software developer who worked at a small company called Piggy Paint<sup>TM</sup>. She generally spent her evenings at home watching movies and reading books. While she was happy and content, she yearned to meet a boy piggy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>

            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Everything changed on an uninteresting winter night in Shadyside. The couple bumped into each other at a little boutique store called Shop Kawaii. Piggy couldn't help but notice how round and circular Emo Piggy was. Emo Piggy was smitten by how white Piggy's fur was. Several weeks later, Emo Piggy received an exciting letter in the mail and the two have been a couple ever since.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Shortly after, Baby Piggy and Baby Emo Piggy were added to the family, bringing with them the excitement of parenthood. As the babies grew, their constant enthusiasm became too much for the young parents to handle. It was here that Emo Piggy Two joined to be the family babysitter. Each day, she would help to keep the babies under control as they jumped and bounced about the house.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='image_cell'>
              <div></div>

              <div></div>
            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Eventually, Piggy grew too old and grey to model any more and retired. Together he and Emo Piggy stayed home to take care of the babies while Emo Piggy Two went off to college. She developed a love for Chemisty and graduated with top honors. She had a dream to design her own line of piggy shampoos. Together with her college friend Pink Piggy, she designed a very special shampoo formula that resulted in super soft fur and a bright, smooth complexion.</p>

          <div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>As she struggled to get funding for her business, she met a very large and successful business piggy. Big Piggy was one of the founders of PiggyBook and a gifted entrepreneur. The two hit it off immediately and began dating. With help from Big Piggy, Emo Piggy Two Shampoos took off and became one of the largest piggy shampoo manufacturers in the world.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='text'>
              <p>Today, all the piggies reside together in Big Piggy Towers One. They spend their days relaxing and enjoying life while mooching off of Big Piggy's enormous wealth.</p>
