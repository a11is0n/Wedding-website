        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <section>
          <h1>Jack and Allison</h1>
          <div>
            <p>For two people who have spent the last decade coding all the time, it’s funny to think that their first encounter was in a Chemistry class. During the spring semester of 2008 at Carnegie Mellon University, Jack would slog into “Intro to Modern Chemistry” and sit in the back. In between the boring lectures (hey, the ECE major required us to take a science class) he started to notice a pretty girl sitting a few rows in front of him carrying a Phantom of the Opera bag.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>It wasn’t until a few months later where they would meet again when Allison joined the board of ARCC, a Chinese cultural club at CMU. It was the first meeting of the year and Allison was running late. She arrived at the meeting room and found only one seat remaining: the one directly next to Jack (probably because nobody else wanted to sit next to him).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>From here the two talked for the first time. The terribly interesting topic: “How to hand your resume to recruiters at a job fair.” After a series of ARCC dumpling nights and late night encounters in the ECE lab, a very peculiar thing happened. The pair was chatting on AOL Instant Messenger when Jack asked Allison if she had eaten dinner yet. She replied with a confused “No” and hasty plans were made.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>It was Lulu’s Noodles that would play host to the future couple. While the food was less than spectacular, Allison ended the meal with a fortune cookie that would change her life forever: “Accept the next proposition you hear.” With the blessing of the fortune cookie gods and a nervous smile, Jack made a proposition and Allison accepted.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>For the following 2 years, the couple enjoyed their time together while bouncing amongst computer labs, ARCC events, and company info sessions with free pizza. Along the way, Jack decided to run the yearly ARCC cultural show and Allison helped as Secretary. Everything seemed perfect until 2010 commencement snuck up and forced Jack to stop being lazy and get a job. In the meanwhile, Allison still had her senior year to finish.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Thus began a 1 year stretch where Allison and Jack would talk on the phone a lot and tell each other boring facts about what happened during the day. Allison decided she would also try her hand at running the ARCC cultural show and eventually gave birth to Medium Panda. Although 2500 miles separated them, their love remained true.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Luckily, all the tech companies in the world are in the San Francisco Bay Area and no interview questions could keep such a powerful love apart. The couple managed to both get jobs in the Bay Area and were finally united under one roof. It was now when they decided to invite two tiny balls of fur into their lives.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Dragon is the spoiled baby of the family. As a kitten she was an adorable and loving companion and as she grows older, she continues to sleep in our bed every night. Jokulhaups was a tiny, destructive force that was never short of energy. As he grew, both in age and in size, he settled down into a grumpy old man who opens doors and sulks under tables.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The family of four enjoyed their daily lives until after some time, Jack got bored at work. He moved to a startup called Storm8 and started making mobile games. He had such a great time that 7 months and 1 referral bonus later, Allison also joined Storm8. Together, they work late into the night shipping games and having a blast doing it.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>On an innocuous Tuesday night, Allison attended a piano concert in San Francisco. Little did she know that the true show was back home in San Mateo. As she walked through her apartment door she was greeted by ravishing young lad with a bouquet of flowers. He escorted her to a piano and sang a touching love song he wrote. As the melody subsided, he took to his knee and pledged himself to her for the rest of his life.</p>
